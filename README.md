# **Hello Pari!**

Welcome to your PocketMD tech challenge!

We're thrilled to have you take this task!

This will help you better understand the stack that we use and will be the first step for us to understand your technical knowledge.

## **Quick Start**

To run locally the below command:

```
git clone git@github.com:PocketMD/___REPO_NAME___.git && cd ___REPO_NAME___ && yarn && yarn dev
```

## **The task**

### Summary

Your task is to build a simple multi-step (3 steps) form using [React-Hook-Form](https://react-hook-form.com/api/).

1. In the first step you should collect some basic information about the user (2-3 fields will do) details about the fields we'll leave up to you.
2. Second step should collect some additional information (details are totally up to you, you have total freedom to choose the names and the types content for the fields). There's no right or wrong types or names of fields! :)
3. The last step should include a single check mark (or radio) input that results in a boolean (true/false) and finish off by showing summary of all 3 steps inside the `onSubmit` handler. Simple logging of the data to the console will work just fine.

The steps should be animated (you may choose the animation - it can be either simple fade-in and fade-out or slide-in or out, or any other approach will work too!).

It should be possible for the user to navigate between steps.
The form data should persist between steps.

The animation should be built out with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/).
